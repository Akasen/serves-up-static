<h1>About This Project</h1>
<p>This project was an undertaking to convert and improve upon code from my friends work on a project she called Coffee-Time, both as a means of exercise and as an act of good will to them. However, this project at this moment is currently abandoned, with little in any reasonable plans to revive it as I am pursuing the learning of React to make this project instead</p>

<h1>Brief History</h1>
<p>This project aimed to create a basic countdown timer in Javascript, HTML, and the Bootstrap library to quickly create a timer for the purposes of time tracking for CCG tourney's. However, as the project proceeded, new things were constantly being learned, old code was having to be re-written substantially, and I was basically becoming very discouraged as to the very fact this project was becoming seemingly far more complicated than it should have been.</p>

<p>Initially, everything I was doing was done procedurally. Then it had come to my attention that it would be possible to implement the timers as a Class. However, there came the issue of wiring the classes to the DOM, or something of that nature. It's been only a couple days since I stopped working on this project, but I already don't recall what issue I had anymore</p>

<p>Anyways, the scope of the project, trying to rework older code and so forth became so daunting, I just decided that starting from scratch and just using React seemed like a saner idea and would lead to less grey hairs</p>
